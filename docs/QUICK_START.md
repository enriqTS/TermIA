TermIA> ls
src  tests  main.py  README.md

TermIA> ls -la
drwxr-xr-x  src
drwxr-xr-x  tests
-rw-r--r--  main.py
-rw-r--r--  README.md

TermIA> cd src
Changed directory to: /home/user/TermIA/src

TermIA> cat ../README.md
# TermIA - Terminal Inteligente
...
```

### AI Commands
```bash
TermIA> ia ask "What is a compiler?"
[IA] Processing question...
A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a
programming language into machine code or another programming language...

TermIA> ia summarize "Python is a high-level programming language..." --length short
[IA] Summarizing text (size: short)...
Summary:
Python is a popular high-level programming language known for
simplicity and versatility.

TermIA> ia translate "Good morning" --to pt
[IA] Translating to pt...

```

### Using Autocomplete
```bash
TermIA> l<Tab>              # Suggests: ls
TermIA> ls -<Tab>           # Suggests: -a, -l, -h, -la, -lh, -lah
TermIA> ia <Tab>            # Suggests: ask, summarize, codeexplain, translate
TermIA> cat READ<Tab>       # Suggests: README.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
Install missing dependencies:
```bash
pip install ply colorama requests pyyaml prompt_toolkit pygments
```

### Syntax highlighting not working
Make sure Pygments is installed:
```bash
pip install pygments
```

### Enhanced features disabled
This is normal on some terminals. The terminal will fallback to basic mode automatically.
To force basic mode:
```bash
python main.py --basic  # (if implemented)
```

### Command not recognized
- Type `help` to see all available commands
- Check command syntax with `help <command>`
- Use Tab completion to discover available options

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Use Tab liberally**: Press Tab after any command or partial word to see suggestions

2. **Search history**: Press `Ctrl+R` and start typing to find previous commands

3. **Quick navigation**:
   - `cd ..` to go up
   - `cd ~` to go home
   - `pwd` to see where you are

4. **AI commands**: Enclose text in quotes for AI commands:
   ```bash
   ia ask "Your question here"
   ```

5. **View history**: Use `history 50` to see your last 50 commands

6. **File operations**:
   - Use `ls -la` for detailed file listings
   - Use `cat` to quickly view file contents
   - Use Tab to autocomplete file paths

## Debug Mode

Run with debug mode to see tokens and AST:
```bash
python main.py --debug
```

This will show:
- Tokens generated by the lexer
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure
- Detailed error information

## Version Information

Check version:
```bash
python main.py --version
```

Show help:
```bash
python main.py --help
```

## Getting Help

- In-terminal: `help` or `help <command>`
- Documentation: See `README.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- Issues: Check project repository for known issues

## Next Steps

1. Explore all OS commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cat`
2. Try AI features: `ia ask`, `ia summarize`, `ia codeexplain`, `ia translate`
3. Learn keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation
4. Customize your experience in `config.yaml`
5. Check command history to repeat common tasks
